    <!-- A winning number between 1-100 will be randomly generated.
    [The player inputs their guess in a text input field.
    [The player clicks a button to submit their guess.
    If the player guesses the winning number, they win! Otherwise, they are allowed to try again.
    The game should give a hint after each guess, letting them know whether to guess higher or lower as well as how close they are.
    After five unsuccessful guesses, the game is over and the player loses. -->
